Outline for final project

#Extract repeat domains from full AA sequence of human MUC16  -- done with blast, will be automated later if time
  Find indecies of repeat domains through alignment -- done with blast
  Extract repeat domains into individual AA seqences -- done, see subsetfasta.jl

#Create a concensus sequence of one of the 156AA repeat domains from the 64 in human MUC16
  Take set of 64 156AA sequences, and find the 'average' sequence to use as a repeat template
  Identify set of most conserved AA loci for future conformational evaluation
    #Arguments:
      inputs: Multiple sequence alignment in fasta format
              optional inputs for how to handle gaps/trimming?
              optional inputs for how to calculate distance matrix
      output: fastq format with single aa sequnece and a quality output that describes the level of conservation of each residue.
              distance matrix of the comparison between each repeat
  
  
#Create phylogeny of these 64
  Compare distances between each sequence, and create a distance matrix
  use this distance matrix to make a phylogenetic tree
    #Arguments:
      inputs: distance matrix in dataframe format
              1 dimensional array of names of the sequences that were compared (can get from the headers of the dataframe)
      output: a file with a string that is a phylogenetic tree in Newick format (e.g. (((A, (B, C)), D). Use UPGMA.
      
#use EcoJulia or phylogenies.jl to visualize this phylogenetic tree
      



If there is time:

#Write a function that takes an amino acid sequence of MUC16 from another organism, and aligns it with the concensus repeat sequence from the human
  take two AA seqences (reference and sample) and aligns them.
    Get the indecies of the aligned regions from the sample sequence.
    Subset the sample sequence into individual repeat sequences based on those indecies
    Add these to the distance matrix from above, and create phylogenetic tree
