Code outline for final project

#Extract repeat domains from full AA sequence of human MUC16
  Find indecies of repeat domains through alignment
  Extract repeat domains into individual AA seqences

#Create a concensus sequence of one of the 156AA repeat domains from the 60 in human MUC16:
  Take set of 60 156AA sequences, and find the 'average' sequence to use as a repeat template
  Identify set of most conserved AA loci for future conformational evaluation
  
#Create phylogeny of these 60
  Compare distances between each sequence, and create a distance matrix
  use this distance matrix to make a phylogenetic tree

#Write a function that takes an amino acid sequence of MUC16 from another organism, and aligns it with the concensus repeat sequence from the human
  take two AA seqences (reference and sample) and aligns them.
    Get the indecies of the aligned regions from the sample sequence.
    Subset the sample sequence into individual repeat sequences based on those indecies
    Add these to the distance matrix from above, and create phylogenetic tree
    
#Compare alosteric differences between amino acid sequences
  Using the one pdb file of a section of a repeat domain of MUC16 (mouse) compare this AA sequence to each other repeat sequence
  note any changes in well conserved-AA, or in AA identified as important in the liturature.
  Visualize differences by highlighting changed AA in pdb file viewer (pymol or julia alternative?)
